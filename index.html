      <h2>Alan Bean</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Bean was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in
        October 1963. He served as backup astronaut for the Gemini 10 and Apollo
        9 missions. Captain Bean was lunar module pilot on Apollo 12, mans
        second lunar landing. In November 1969, Captain Bean and Captain Pete
        Conrad landed in the moons Ocean of Stormsafter a flight of some 250,000
        miles. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface
        experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on
        the moon to provide the power source. Captain Richard Gordon remained in
        lunar orbit photographing landing sites for future missions. Captain
        Bean was spacecraft commander of Skylab Mission II (SL-3), July 29 to
        September 25, 1973. With him on the 59-day, 24,400,000 mile world record
        setting flight were scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K. Garriott and Marine
        Corps Lieutenant Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Mission II accomplished 150% of
        its pre-mission forecast goals. On his next assignment, Captain Bean was
        backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the
        joint American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Captain Bean has
        logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in spaceof which 10 hours and 26
        minutes were spent in EVAs on the moon and in earth orbit.

      <h2>Alan Shepard</h2>
      <p>
        Rear Admiral Shepard was one of the Mercury astronauts named by NASA in
        April 1959, and he holds the distinction of being the first American to
        journey into space. On May 5, 1961, in the Freedom 7 spacecraft, he was
        launched by a Redstone vehicle on a ballistic trajectory suborbital
        flight--a flight which carried him to an altitude of 116 statute miles
        and to a landing point 302 statute miles down the Atlantic Missile
        Range. In 1963, he was designated Chief of the Astronaut Office with
        responsibility for monitoring the coordination, scheduling, and control
        of all activities involving NASA astronauts. This included monitoring
        the development and implementation of effective training programs to
        assure the flight readiness of available pilot/non-pilot personnel for
        assignment to crew positions on manned space flights; furnishing pilot
        evaluations applicable to the design, construction, and operations of
        spacecraft systems and related equipment; and providing qualitative
        scientific and engineering observations to facilitate overall mission
        planning, formulation of feasible operational procedures, and selection
        and conduct of specific experiments for each flight. He was restored to
        full flight status in May 1969, following corrective surgery for an
        inner ear disorder. Shepard made his second space flight as spacecraft
        commander on Apollo 14, January 31 - February 9, 1971. He was
        accompanied on man's third lunar landing mission by Stuart A. Roosa,
        command module pilot, and Edgar D. Mitchell, lunar module pilot.
        Maneuvering their lunar module, "Antares," to a landing in the hilly
        upland Fra Mauro region of the moon, Shepard and Mitchell subsequently
        deployed and activated various scientific equipment and experiments and
        collected almost 100 pounds of lunar samples for return to earth. Other
        Apollo 14 achievements included: first use of Mobile Equipment
        Transporter (MET); largest payload placed in lunar orbit; longest
        distance traversed on the lunar surface; largest payload returned from
        the lunar surface; longest lunar surface stay time (33 hours); longest
        lunar surface EVA (9 hours and 17 minutes); first use of shortened lunar
        orbit rendezvous techniques; first use of colored TV with new vidicon
        tube on lunar surface; and first extensive orbital science period
        conducted during CSM solo operations.

      <h2>Buzz Aldrin</h2>
      <p>
        Aldrin was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October
        1963. On November 11, 1966, he and command pilot James Lovell were
        launched into space in the Gemini 12 spacecraft on a 4-day flight, which
        brought the Gemini program to a successful close. Aldrin established a
        new record for extravehicular activity (EVA), spending 5-1/2 hours
        outside the spacecraft. He served as lunar module pilot for Apollo 11,
        July 16-24, 1969, the first manned lunar landing mission. Aldrin
        followed Neil Armstrong onto the lunar surface on July 20, 1969,
        completing a 2-hour and 15 minute lunar EVA. In July 1971, Aldrin
        resigned from NASA. Aldrin has logged 289 hours and 53 minutes in space,
        of which, 7 hours and 52 minutes were spent in EVA.

      <h2>David Scott</h2>
      <p>
        Scott was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October
        1963. On March 16, 1966, he and command pilot Neil Armstrong were
        launched into space on the Gemini 8 mission--a flight originally
        scheduled to last three days but terminated early due to a
        malfunctioning thruster. The crew performed the first successful docking
        of two vehicles in space and demonstrated great piloting skill in
        overcoming the thruster problem and bringing the spacecraft to a safe
        landing. Scott served as command module pilot for Apollo 9, March 3-13,
        1969. This was the third manned flight in the Apollo series, the second
        to be launched by a Saturn V, and the first to complete a comprehensive
        earth-orbital qualification and verification test of a "fully configured
        Apollo spacecraft." The ten-day flight provided vital information
        previously not available on the operational performance, stability, and
        reliability of lunar module propulsion and life support systems.
        Highlight of this evaluation was completion of a critical lunar-orbit
        rendezvous simulation and subsequent docking, initiated by James
        McDivitt and Russell Schweickart from within the lunar module at a
        separation distance which exceeded 100 miles from the command/service
        module piloted by Scott. The crew also demonstrated and confirmed the
        operational feasibility of crew transfer and extravehicular activity
        techniques and equipment, with Schweickart completing a 46-minute EVA
        outside the lunar module. During this period, Dave Scott completed a
        1-hour stand-up EVA in the open command module hatch photographing
        Schweickart's activities and also retrieving thermal samples from the
        command module exterior. Apollo 9 splashed down less than four miles
        from the helicopter carrier USS GUADALCANAL. In his next assignment,
        Scott was designated backup spacecraft commander for Apollo 12. He made
        his third space flight as spacecraft commander of Apollo 15, July 26 -
        August 7, 1971. His companions on the flight were Alfred M. Worden
        (command module pilot) and James B. Irwin (lunar module pilot). Apollo
        15 was the fourth manned lunar landing mission and the first to visit
        and explore the moon's Hadley Rille and Apennine Mountains which are
        located on the southeast edge of the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The
        lunar module, "Falcon," remained on the lunar surface for 66 hours and
        54 minutes (setting a new record for lunar surface stay time) and Scott
        and Irwin logged 18 hours and 35 minutes each in extravehicular
        activities conducted during three separate excursions onto the lunar
        surface. Using "Rover-1" to transport themselves and their equipment
        along portions of Hadley Rille and the Apennine Mountains, Scott and
        Irwin performed a selenological inspection and survey of the area and
        collected 180 pounds of lunar surface materials. They deployed an ALSEP
        package which involved the emplacement and activation of surface
        experiments, and their lunar surface activities were televised using a
        TV camera which was operated remotely by ground controllers stationed in
        the mission control center located at Houston, Texas. Other Apollo 15
        achievements include: largest payloads ever placed into earth and lunar
        orbits; first scientific instrument module bay flown and operated on an
        Apollo spacecraft; longest distance traversed on lunar surface; first
        use of a lunar surface navigation device (mounted on Rover-1); first
        subsatellite launched in lunar orbit; and first extravehicular (EVA)
        from a command module during transearth coast. The latter feat performed
        by Worden during three excursions to "Endeavour's" SIM-bay where he
        retrieved film cassettes from the panoramic and mapping cameras and
        reported his personal observations of the general condition of equipment
        housed there. Apollo 15 concluded with a Pacific Ocean splashdown and
        subsequent recovery by the USS OKINAWA.
